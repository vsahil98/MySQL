Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee table.
+----+--------+ 
| Id | Salary | 
+----+--------+ 
|1.   |100 | 
|2.   |200 | 
|3.   |300 | 
+----+--------+

For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return 200 as the
second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, then the query
should return null.
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+
